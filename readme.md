# Engineering_Team
A group of agents that is able to create a basic frontend, backend and testing for a Python program :D

Agents

Lead Engineer: Takes the requirements of the application and outlines a draft of how the application will play out. This will then pass it on to the Backend Engineer!

Backend Engineer: Takes the given prompts and outline from Lead Engineer and starts creating the backend of the application! This will then pass it on to the Front-end Engineer. (runs code in Docker!)

Front-end Engineer: Takes the backend code and will create a Gradio UI that is compatible :D. This will then pass it back to the QA Engineer

QA Engineer: With the given code creates test cases for the application to ensure that it will compile and run properly! (runs code in Docker!)

Check out this demo video: [Click me I dare you! :3](https://youtu.be/ZNWKNP0TeZ4)

Correction in the video: I say that the Lead Engineer is delegating tasks originally I had the Lead Engineer listed as a manager but instead we are just passing it down as listed above! Might make a seperate folder in the future (when I have time) that has a manager lead these 4 agents which would leave us with 5 total agents!
